suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using f-strings or .format() for better readability when constructing strings in `get_info`.
- In the get_short_info method, you could simplify the conditional logic for creating the animals_str by using a more concise approach.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements the `Farm` class with `__init__`, `add_animal`, `get_info`, `get_animal_types`, and `get_short_info` methods, as described in the chapter content. It correctly handles single and multiple animal additions, formats the output according to the example, and sorts the animal types. The upgraded `add_animal` using `**kwargs` is also correctly implemented. All requirements are met.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The use of descriptive variable names and comments enhances readability. However, the string concatenation in `get_info` could be improved with f-strings.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient. The use of `setdefault` in `add_animal` avoids redundant checks. String concatenation can be slightly optimized using f-strings. But overall performance is good.
- security: The code doesn't have any apparent security vulnerabilities. There's no user input or external data being processed that could lead to injection attacks or other security issues.
