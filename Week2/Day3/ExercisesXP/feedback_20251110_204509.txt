suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, while the implementation correctly uses dunder methods, consider adding `__radd__` for right addition to handle cases where the integer comes before the Currency object in addition.
- In Exercise 1, the __slots__ attribute is a good optimization, but its usage here isn't crucial for correctness.  It can be removed without impacting functionality.
- In Exercise 2, code was not provided. It would have been beneficial to have the code for this exercise.
- In Exercise 7, it would improve readability to format the address output more clearly, for example, by replacing newline characters with commas and spaces.
- In Exercise 7, consider adding exception handling (try-except blocks) around the Faker calls in case of network or library-related issues.
