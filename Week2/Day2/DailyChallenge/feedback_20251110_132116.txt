Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all the requirements of the pagination system, including the `Pagination` class with `__init__`, `get_visible_items`, `go_to_page`, `first_page`, `last_page`, `next_page`, `previous_page`, and `__str__` methods. It handles edge cases like empty lists and out-of-range page numbers with `ValueError` as requested and also the bonus part of method chaining. All methods perform exactly as requested in the instructions.
- readability: The code is well-formatted and uses descriptive variable names, making it easy to understand.  Comments are used effectively to explain the purpose of each method, which is beneficial for readability.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the given task.  List slicing is used which generally has good performance characteristics.
- security: The code doesn't involve any external inputs or operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities. The type checking in `go_to_page` is a good practice.
