suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding a docstring to `get_valid_price` and `get_valid_percent` functions to improve documentation.
- The code could benefit from input validation to prevent empty drink names when adding items.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all the required functions (show_menu, add_item, update_price, delete_item, show_options, run_coffee_shop) and their specified behavior as described in the chapter content. It also correctly handles invalid inputs and edge cases, such as an empty menu or an item not being found.
- readability: The code is well-structured and uses descriptive variable names. The functions are relatively short and easy to understand. The use of f-strings enhances readability. Minor improvements could be made by adding more docstrings.
- performance: The code uses efficient data structures and algorithms for the given task. The performance is adequate for the scale of the problem. The input validation functions ensure that the program doesn't crash due to invalid input.
- security: The code doesn't have any apparent security vulnerabilities. Input validation is used to prevent crashes due to invalid input. No user-provided input is directly executed as code.
