suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more descriptive comments to enhance readability, especially for complex logic.
- The "Hello World" exercise could be improved by using '\n' instead of creating an additional space.
Brief justification:
- correctness: All exercises are correctly implemented according to the instructions provided in the chapter content. Each exercise addresses the specified problem accurately and completely.
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to understand. Variable names are descriptive, and the logic is straightforward. Readability could be further improved with slightly more comments.
- performance: The code is efficient and performs well, as it uses basic operations and appropriate data structures for each exercise.
- security: The code does not involve any security vulnerabilities. User inputs are appropriately handled, and no sensitive information is exposed.
