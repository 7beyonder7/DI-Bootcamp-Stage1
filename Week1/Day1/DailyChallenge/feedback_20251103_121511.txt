Brief justification:
- correctness: The code directly and accurately implements all instructions from the Chapter Content/Questions. It correctly takes user input, validates the string length, prints the first and last characters, builds the string character by character using a for loop, and shuffles the string as a bonus. Each step aligns perfectly with the given requirements.
- readability: The code is well-formatted, uses meaningful variable names, and includes comments that clearly explain each section's purpose, making it easy to understand.
- performance: The code's performance is optimal for the given task. It uses efficient string manipulation techniques and avoids unnecessary computations.
- security: The code does not involve any security vulnerabilities. The user input is handled safely without exposing the system to any risks.
