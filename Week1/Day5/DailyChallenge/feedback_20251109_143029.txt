Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements both challenges as described in the Chapter Content/Questions. Challenge 1 sorts comma-separated words, and Challenge 2 finds the longest word in a sentence. The expected outputs are also accurate.
- readability: The code is well-commented and follows a logical structure, making it easy to understand.
- performance: The code is efficient enough for the given problem size. `sort()` and `split()` are standard Python functions.
- security: The code does not have any apparent security concerns since it does not deal with sensitive data or external resources.
