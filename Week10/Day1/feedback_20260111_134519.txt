suggestions for improvement:
- This package.json contains dependencies for the entire project including the webserver, cli, web scraping and more. Consider including the source code to assess the project holistically, providing valuable insights into the implementation of individual features and their integration.

suggestions for improvement:
- This package.json file provides metadata about a Node.js project. While generally well-structured, it's missing key implementation details. Specifically, the prompt asks for server and client-side code, API endpoint implementations, and a README with setup instructions and example calls. This file only describes the dependencies and scripts but doesn't fulfill the actual functional requirements outlined in the prompt.
- Consider adding a linting and formatting script to maintain code quality and consistency.
- While `node-fetch` is used, explore native `fetch` API available in Node.js 18+ to avoid external dependencies where possible.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more comprehensive error handling examples in the Postman collection, such as cases where the LLM or search API returns an error.
- While the collection includes authentication, clarify in the description for each request that Bearer token authentication is required.
- Add tests to the Postman collection to validate the structure and content of the responses automatically. This helps ensure that the API behaves as expected.

URL: https://github.com/7beyonder7/DI-Bootcamp-Stage1/blob/main/Week10/Day1/src/cli.js
suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more robust error handling for network requests, such as retry mechanisms or exponential backoff.
- Implement input validation on the client-side to prevent malformed requests from being sent to the server.
- While Bearer token auth is implemented, consider more advanced authentication mechanisms for production environments.

URL: https://github.com/7beyonder7/DI-Bootcamp-Stage1/blob/main/Week10/Day1/src/server.js
suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding validation to ensure `k` in `search_web` stays within reasonable bounds to prevent abuse of the search API.
- Implement more robust error handling and logging, especially around the Ollama calls.  Consider retry logic.
- Add rate limiting to the API to prevent abuse, particularly for the search_web and summarize_with_citations endpoints.
